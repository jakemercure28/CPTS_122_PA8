This is the readme.md for this project

Commits are not allowed directly into main.
If you are working on code you must:
1) create a branch off of main 
2) commit your work to that branch
3) create a pull request into main
4) then after the pull request is made 
we will review the code and comment before approving and merging the code into the main repo
